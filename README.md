This is a Data Analytics project that I worked on for a university project 

🚦 Road Accident Data Analytics & Random Forest Project
📌 Overview

This project performs end-to-end data analytics, visualization, and machine learning on a road accident dataset. The workflow includes data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), visual analysis of accident patterns, and training a Random Forest classifier to analyze accident severity and feature importance.

🔍 What This Project Covers

Data cleaning and preprocessing
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Data visualization using charts and plots
Encoding categorical variables
Training and evaluating a Random Forest classification model
Model performance evaluation (accuracy & classification report)
Feature importance analysis

🛠️ Technologies Used

Python
Pandas, NumPy – data processing
Matplotlib, Seaborn – visualization
Scikit-learn – Random Forest, preprocessing, evaluation
Google Colab

📊 Key Insights

Accident trends vary significantly by day of week, time of day, and road conditions
Certain factors such as accident severity, vehicle involvement, and environmental conditions strongly influence outcomes
Random Forest helps identify important features contributing to accident severity
